World Of Warcraft Item Finder

I created this application utilizing an API from Blizard Entertainment. The user will enter an item by name/keyword and the table will be populated with all relative items.

Link to project: https://wowitemfinder.netlify.app

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created everything from scratch. Lightweight CSS and Vanilla JS. The main page has a table that gets populated once the user enters an item into the search bar and searches an item

Lessons Learned: Next time, I will use an ACTUAL html table to populate, rather than dynamically creating elements and using css to structure it to look like a table, as this process was extremely tedious and seemingly unnecessary..
